Hi, I'm Rick, a Cloud Platform Engineer specializing in infrastructure automation, reliability engineering, and DevOps practices. I thrive at the intersection of technical expertise and business value, building scalable, resilient systems with a focus on operational excellence and maintaining high availability across Google Cloud Platform and AWS environments.

Having held certifications as a GCP Professional Cloud Architect, GCP DevOps Engineer, GCP Cloud Digital Leader, and AWS Certified Solutions Architect, I've helped enterprises navigate complex infrastructure challenges while maintaining performance and driving cost efficiencies. At SADA Systems (acquired by Insight Enterprises) and Taos (acquired by IBM), I partnered with enterprise clients to transform their cloud infrastructure, optimize operations, and reduce expenses.

My approach to engineering combines technical depth with business awareness. While working on site at Google, I encountered a client with a struggling Dataflow pipeline. Instead of simply increasing their quota limits, I reviewed their query history and noticed a pattern of consistently requesting higher quotas. By examining their actual query structure, I identified inefficiencies that, when addressed, eliminated the need for increased quotas and resulted in significant cost savings. This analysis led to a solution that improved performance while substantially reducing their cloud expenses. At Rakuten, I applied DevOps principles to security operations by developing a containerized Python tool that automated phishing analysis workflows, significantly accelerating the cybersecurity team's response capabilities.

My technology journey began in the dial-up era, building websites on Geocities and discovering the power of user experience. This early passion led me to Holberton School in San Francisco, where I strengthened my computer science foundations through hands on projects using C, web development frameworks, and automation with Python and Bash.

Today, I leverage this diverse background as a freelance consultant, helping clients implement robust CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code solutions, and comprehensive monitoring systems that enhance reliability while reducing operational costs. I focus on implementing SRE best practices, reducing technical debt, and optimizing cloud operations for maximum business impact. When not immersed in improving system reliability, I enjoy outdoor adventures with my family which provide fresh perspectives on technical challenges and keep me energized.
