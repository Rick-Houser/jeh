Hi, I'm Rick Houser, a Cloud Platform Engineer with an infrastructure and automation background and a passion for crafting scalable solutions. My tech journey began in the dial-up era, building websites on Geocities and discovering the power of user experience and persistence. That curiosity propelled me to Holberton School in San Francisco, where I learned computer science fundamentals using C, built web applications with Python, and developed automation scripts with Python and Bash.

Since 2018, I've thrived in DevOps and cloud engineering roles. At Taos (acquired by IBM in 2021), I earned certifications as a GCP Professional Cloud Architect and AWS Certified Solutions Architect while working on-site at Google to tackle complex cloud challenges for enterprise customers. In one instance, rather than simply increasing quota limits for a customer's struggling Dataflow pipeline, I identified an underlying query inefficiency and facilitated a solution that improved performance while significantly reducing their costs. At Rakuten, I developed a containerized Python tool to automate phishing analysis, boosting the cybersecurity team's efficiency. Later, at SADA Systems (acquired by Insight Enterprises in 2023), I served as a Solutions Engineer / Technical Account Manager, helping GCP customers optimize costs and streamline operations while adding certifications like GCP DevOps Engineer and GCP Cloud Digital Leader.

Recently, I've been freelancing, assisting clients in reducing tech debt and cloud expenses—demonstrating my ability to drive results across diverse environments. Outside of tech, I enjoy family time and outdoor adventures, which keep me energized and provide fresh perspectives on technical challenges.
