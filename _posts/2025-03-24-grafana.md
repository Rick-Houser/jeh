_Grafana dashboard showing app metrics_

Hey reliability fans, welcome back! Last time, we built a Flask app from scratch, slapped some Prometheus metrics on it, and tagged it as v1.0—a solid SRE foundation. Now, in Phase 2, we’re cranking up the observability dial by adding Grafana to the mix. Those raw numbers we collected? They’re about to turn into dashboards that make your app’s heartbeat visible. This isn’t just pretty graphs—it’s about understanding your system, a core SRE skill. Let’s break down the three steps I took to get here, why it’s a game-changer, and how you can do it too. Buckle up—we’re tagging v2.0 today!

## Step 1: Hook Up Grafana to the Stack
First, I needed Grafana running alongside my Flask app and Prometheus. I fired up Docker Compose—my trusty sidekick—and added a Grafana service. A quick tweak to the docker-compose.yml, a docker-compose up, and bam—Grafana was live on port 3000. It’s like adding a new screen to your control room, ready to show off the data we’ve been collecting.

- `Takeaway:` Stacking services like this is how SREs build observability—each tool has a job, and they play nice together.
- `Action:` Toss Grafana into your Docker setup. Pull the image, map port 3000, and give it a spin—your app doesn’t even need to know it’s there.

## Step 2: Connect the Dots with Prometheus
With Grafana running, I pointed it at Prometheus—our metrics goldmine from Phase 1. Logged into Grafana (default admin/admin—changed it to something snappy), added a Prometheus data source with http://prometheus:9090, and hit “Save & Test.” Green light! Now Grafana could see all those request counts and latencies we’d been tracking. It’s like plugging in a monitor to your app’s vital signs.

- `Takeaway:` Data sources are the glue in observability—without them, your dashboards are just blank canvases.
- `Action:` Link Grafana to your metrics store (Prometheus in my case). Use the service name from Docker Compose—it’s networking magic.

## Step 3: Build Dashboards That Pop
Here’s where it gets fun—I built a dashboard to see what my app’s up to. Dropped in a “Request Rate” panel with rate(request_count[5m])—boom, requests per second over time. Then added a “Request Latency” panel with request_processing_seconds—suddenly, I could watch how fast (or slow) my app responds. Hit the API a few times with curl, refreshed the dashboard, and there it was: lines moving, numbers making sense. Tagged it v2.0—this feels like SRE victory.

- `Takeaway:` Dashboards turn metrics into stories—spikes, trends, and patterns you can act on. That’s RED method vibes (Rate, Errors, Duration) coming alive!
- `Action:` Create a couple panels—rate and latency are great starters. Query your metrics, pick a graph, and watch your app talk back.

## Why This Matters for SRE
Phase 2 isn’t just about pretty pictures—it’s about visibility, a cornerstone of reliability. With Grafana, I’m not guessing how my app’s doing—I’m seeing it. Request rates show me traffic (Rate from RED), latency tracks performance (Duration), and I’m prepped to add errors next. This is how SREs stay ahead of trouble—by knowing what’s normal before it’s not. Plus, it’s a step toward USE (Utilization, Saturation, Errors)—we’ll get there with more metrics soon. You’re not just coding now; you’re observing like a pro.

## Try It Yourself
Ready to see your app in a new light? Here’s the quick playbook:

1. Add Grafana to your Docker Compose file—port 3000, a volume for persistence, done.
2. Connect it to your Prometheus instance—point it at the right URL and test it.
3. Build a dashboard—grab a couple metrics (like request rate), tweak the visuals, and hit your app to see it live.

Clone my [**repo**](https://github.com/Rick-Houser/system-prism) and checkout **v2.0**—it’s all there, from Flask to Grafana. Fire it up with docker-compose up, hit localhost:3000, and play with the dashboards. Questions? Drop ‘em in the comments—I’m all about sharing the SRE love!

## Best Practices Recap
- `Keep It Simple:` Start with a few panels—rate and latency are plenty to get hooked.
- `Persist It:` Use Docker volumes so your dashboards don’t vanish on restart.
- `Name Smart:` Service names in configs (like prometheus) keep things tidy and portable.

## Up Next
Phase 3’s on deck—we’ll add some alarms with Alertmanager and take this show to the cloud with a real deployment. Think notifications when things go sideways and running it somewhere other than my laptop. Plus, we’ll sneak in those error metrics to round out RED. Keep hanging out—we’re making this app bulletproof, one phase at a time!
