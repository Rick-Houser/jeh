    <h2>Hi, I'm Rick!</h2>
    <p>I develop tools and applications that help teams work more efficiently while creating technical documentation that makes complex technologies easier to understand. I've built automation tools for enterprise environments, developed applications that streamline workflows, and written technical guides that break down advanced concepts into practical steps.</p>
    <p>I focus on building solutions that reduce operational costs and improve reliability. You can read about specific projects and their results on my <a href="{% link _tabs/about me.md %}" class="fw-bold">About Me</a> page.</p>
    <p>My <a href="{% link _tabs/blog.md %}" class="fw-bold">Blog</a> documents the technologies I'm working with and includes implementation guides based on real projects.</p>
